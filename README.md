My simple solar system simulation powered by SFML.
Not worked very well, because energy in the system grows sometimes
and sometimes decreases.

## Next Step
- It is better to do some collison
- Add other forces, like electromagnetic force
- Every parameters are written inside the code, user may adjust it in runtime
